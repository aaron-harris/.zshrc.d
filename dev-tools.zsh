## Dev Tools
#
# Functions and aliases providing access to standard dev tools.  In most cases this is simply an alias to the
# appropriate Windows-native tool, which we assume has been installed and added to the Windows-side PATH.

# Emacs
alias emacs=runemacs.exe

# IntelliJ IDEA
alias ij=idea64.exe
